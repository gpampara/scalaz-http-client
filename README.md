==================

Resurection of Scalaz-Http: A fully funcitonal HTTP client

Note: This is very much a work in progress.

This code is based off the now deprecated scalaz-core, with minor changes. The original
had bindings for use in a servlet type environment, but that is no longer within the source.
Instead, a more general library is planned but servlet bindings may make an
appearance some day again.

The initial goal is to have a HTTP client like library that does not use
any other libraries to achieve its goal.
